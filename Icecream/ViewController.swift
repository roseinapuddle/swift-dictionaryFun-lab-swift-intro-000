/* 1.
 Some of the Flatiron School instructors are putting on a summer ice cream party. Susan, one of the instructors, has collected some information on everyone's favorite ice cream flavors. She only wants to make one trip to the grocery store, though, so she needs you to write some functions to remind her what ice cream she needs to buy when she goes.
 She asked everyone attending the party what their favorite flavor of ice cream is. Here are the people attending the ice cream party, and what their favorite flavors of ice cream are:
 Joe: Peanut Butter and Chocolate
 Tim: Natural Vanilla
 Sophie: Mexican Chocolate
 Deniz: Natural Vanilla
 Tom: Mexican Chocolate
 Jim: Natural Vanilla
 Susan: Cookies 'N' Cream
 In order to help Susan, locate the Icecream.swift file and look for the following comment:
 // 1. Create the Dictionary here. The name of the variable should be favoriteFlavorsOfIceCream
 Right below this comment, you should create a dictionary of type [String : String] and assign a default value to the variable. The keys of this dictionary should be the names and the values associated with each of those keys should be that individuals favorite ice-cream.
 In the IcecreamTests.swift file, you should be able to pass the test listed under // 1. before moving on!

    }
